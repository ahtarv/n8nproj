# 🎬 AI Content Experimentation & Automation Studio (n8n)

## Overview
This project is an **AI-powered content automation system** built using **n8n** to help creators and teams rapidly **generate, iterate, and experiment with short-form content**.

It combines AI tools with automation workflows to reduce manual ideation and enable fast, repeatable **content experiments** across scripts, hooks, and captions.

---

## What It Does
- Generates **content ideas, scripts, hooks, and captions** using AI  
- Creates **multiple variants** for quick experimentation  
- Tags content by **tone, theme, and format**  
- Organizes outputs into **ready-to-post drafts**  
- Reduces repetitive creative work while keeping humans in control  

---

## Why This Exists
Content teams often spend more time brainstorming, rewriting hooks, and formatting captions than actually experimenting.

This system automates the **boring and repetitive parts**, allowing creators to focus on storytelling and execution.

Draft Outputs (Ready-to-Post)

```

## Example Workflow
1. Input a content idea or theme  
2. Generate:
   - 3–5 hooks  
   - short script variations  
   - caption options  
3. Auto-tag outputs (tone, emotion, format)  
4. Export drafts for posting or review  

---

## Technologies Used
- **Automation:** n8n (self-hosted)  
- **AI Tools:** LLM-based text generation  
- **Data Handling:** JSON workflows  
- **Storage:** Local files / Notion / Google Sheets (pluggable)  

---

## Current Scope
- Manual trigger (single idea at a time)  
- Text-based content generation  
- Draft creation (no auto-posting by default)  

This keeps creative control **human-in-the-loop**.

---

## Possible Extensions
- Auto-posting to Instagram / YouTube Shorts  
- Performance tracking (views, engagement)  
- Feedback-driven prompt iteration  
- Multi-platform content formatting  

---

## Author Notes
This project explores the intersection of **AI tools, automation, and storytelling**.

The goal is not to replace creativity, but to **accelerate experimentation**.
